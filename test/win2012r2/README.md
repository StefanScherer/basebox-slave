# Test
This is only a first try to use a packer built box with the vagrant-vcloud plugin.
But on first `vagrant up --provider=vcloud` following error occurs:

    ERROR box_collection: Added box provider doesnt match expected: vcloud
    ERROR warden: Error occurred: The box you attempted to add doesn't match the prov
    ider you specified.
    
    Provider expected: vcloud
    Provider of box: vmware_desktop
